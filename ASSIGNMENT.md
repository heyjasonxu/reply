# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> The best way I learned to use the module was to test and use with the module. None of the details and examples given by the module helped really explained the usage of the module. That was mostly due to my limited knowed of modules. One aspect of the module that made the module easier to learn were the examples. I didn't get much from just reading the examples, but testing the modules helped me explore the full functionality of the module. There weren't many comments in the examples that showed or explained how the module worked. The only thing I could do was to run and test the module. It would have been a lot easier to understand if the author also included some comments in the examples and a example run (input and output) for the example code.

##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Explain the what the function does and goals of the function, not the intericate steps to how the function got to it's end result. You never want to use any methodology and terminology from programming like: while loop, for loop, if-else statement, etc. You want to write the comment in a way that if the process of the function changes, the comments don't have to be modified.

##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 7


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> no


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I did encounter an error when adding jsdocs to my js file. When ever I used the command, `$ jsdoc path/to/file.js -d docs`, would get the error. `ERROR: Unable to parse /Users/jason/Documents/Software Architecture/reply/index.js: Line 114: Octal literals are not allowed in strict mode`. 
I also ran into some difficulties after creating the jsdoc html files. After the html files were created. The html file wasn't able to show all the global methods that the module had. So I had to manually input @function in the comments to make it work properly. 
Due to my limited knowledge of javascript, there were a lot of the syntax and methods in the code were unfamiliar with me. This lead me into doing a lot a searches online for answers.
