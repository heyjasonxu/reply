# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> The best way I learned to use the module was to test and play with the module. None of the details and examples given by the module helped really explained the usage of the module. One aspect of the module that made it easy were the examples, there were many examples that displayed the full functionality of the whole module. But unfortunately I wasn't able to get that all from just reading the code. There weren't any comments in the examples that showed or explained how the module worked. The only thing I could do was to run and test the module. It would have been a lot easier to understand if the author also included some comments in the examples and a example run (nput and output) for the example code.

##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Explain the what the function does and goals of the function, not the intericate steps to how the function got to it's end result. You never want to use any methodology and terminology from programming like: while loop, for loop, if-else statement, etc. You want to write the comment in a way that if the process of the function changes, the comments don't have to be modified.

##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 6


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> no


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I did encounter an error when adding jsdocs to my js file. When ever I used the command, `$ jsdoc path/to/file.js -d docs`, would get the error. `ERROR: Unable to parse /Users/jason/Documents/Software Architecture/reply/index.js: Line 114: Octal literals are not allowed in strict mode`. Also a lot of the syntax and methods in the code were unfamiliar with me. This lead me into doing a lot a searches online for answers.
